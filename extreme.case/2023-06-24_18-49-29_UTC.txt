I sew unassailable yearning in midnight summer's cardigan weaving the pattern of peaceful warmonger of defeated battle whose graveyard is growing the toxic traits of weathered wildflower.

I chew the debris of cataclysmic collision of my heart of hearts as brewed coffee of last night has tasted less bitter on my burned lips than the one I've been gulping from June's dreadful drought. 

I worship your insouciant patterns of insincere phrases while destructing the graveness of my grieving senses to drown in your citrine lake of clemency, I slowly burn all the ropes of hope while leaving my ashes as blasphemy.

I sip poetry of a befallen as an antidote for the poison growing in my bones for the empathy, you buried yesterday with my roots and now shackled in your despair, I've become a parasite feeding on grief.

I paint the egregious behemoth of my fears in a purple butterfly making it drunk on the sweetest nightmare which I'm having from from the moment I leant on your shoulder making my trust twisted.

I feint a spoof of unfettered paradoxes of you and me from the right, swinging it on left for the audience left daydreaming the happy ending in the interval as they believe this hyperbole is just a figure of speech not the story of us.
